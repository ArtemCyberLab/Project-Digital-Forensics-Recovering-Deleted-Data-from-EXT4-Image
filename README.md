I analyzed the structure of disks and mounted partitions using lsblk and df -T, identifying multiple loop devices and two NVMe disks. An attempt to check /usr/src/linux- was unsuccessful as the directory did not exist. Then, I listed the files in the home directory (ls -l) and discovered an EXT4 disk image named ext4_case.img. Navigating to /mnt/ext_exercises, I found numerous files with similar naming patterns and one normal_file.txt. Running (ls -la) revealed that most files were owned by the user analyst.

Next, using stat 17_file.txt, I determined that the file was empty, belonged to the analyst user, and had unusual timestamps: the last access and modification dates were January 1, 2020, while the metadata change and creation dates were January 9, 2025. This suggested that the timestamps had been intentionally altered, a common practice in digital forensics. I then used find to search for files based on modification times, analyzed the disk image with strings and grep, calculated block offsets, and successfully extracted hidden data using dd, applying digital forensic techniques.

Finally, after executing cat /tmp/recovered_FFF, I successfully recovered a hidden flag: THM{sup3r-d3l3ted-fil3-you-g0t-it-nice}, confirming the effective retrieval of deleted data.
